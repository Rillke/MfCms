MfCms with Common Modules (Zf2)
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, content management application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.

I implemented the common modules to start with a fully functional CMS. Modules are listed below;

ZfcUser, ZfcBase, BjyAuthorize, ZnZend.

Work in progress... you can download and try (CRUD is already working).
